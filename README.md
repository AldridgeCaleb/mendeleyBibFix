# mendeleyBibFix

This is a simple function intended to correct bib-files that are automatically generated by Mendeley Desktop. I have found it to work for bib-files generated with the IEEE citation style, but it should work for other styles as well. It makes the following corrections:
	* changes double braces around titles to single braces
	* removes escaping of { and } (will only matter if you checked "Escape LaTeX special characters" in the "Bibtex" Options tab)
	* removes URL for any entry that is not specified as an exception (read the comment block after start of main function to read how to change the exceptions)
    	* removes braces around months

It should work correctly for files generated by Mendeley Desktop v1.16.1.

A number of fixes are hard-coded, i.e., it expects to know where the braces are. So this code runs very fast (bib files with hundreds of entries are fixed in a small fraction of a second) but may not be "future-proof"

You will need to compile this code to run it. A compiled version for windows is included on the release page of Github. If you are going to compile it yourself with gcc, then you will need the -std=c99 option

Call syntax (windows):
 		mendeleyBibFix.exe [OUTPUT_FILENAME] [INPUT_FILENAME]

Both arguments are optional. If there is only one argument, then it is assumed to be the output filename. The default input filename is "library.bib", and the default output filename is "library_fixed.bib"
